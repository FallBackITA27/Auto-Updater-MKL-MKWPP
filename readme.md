This is a Chrome Extension (Firefox soon? ðŸ‘€) that grabs times from a [Chadsoft profile](https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/time-trials/players/1F/7B7D3331A3A008.html#sort-by-date) and compares it to an [MKWPP profile](https://www.mariokart64.com/mkw/profile.php) or an [MKL profile](https://www.mkleaderboards.com/mkw/players/2450).
### Feature list?
1) Automatically submit 3lap times to MKL
2) Automatically submit 3lap times to MKWPP

## How do I download this?
Sadly, I can't put this on the Chrome Webstore, so you have two options:
### 1
You download the repo as a .zip

![Zip DL](https://i.imgur.com/b3VwKA8.png)

Then you extract it in your folder of choice

Then you go to your browser's of choice extension page, it should be <browserNameHere>://extensions (KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS MADE FOR CHROMIUM BASED BROWSERS!)

You click "load unpacked", and select the folder you extracted the extension in.

### 2
You could donate 5$ for me to publish on the Webstore!
(Not yet ready, I'm not 18 and don't have a PayPal yet lol)
